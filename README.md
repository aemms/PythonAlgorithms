2. fibonacci.py 
3. fibonacci2.py

## gcd.py - Greatest Common Divisor Algorithm

Returns and prints the Greatest Common Divisor of two Integers.

- To run, within the containing directory, type: 'python gcd.py'.
- The input integers can be manipulated within the source code.

## fibonacci.py

Returns the nth value of the fibonacci sequence; by definition, the first two values are 0 and 1. The following values (n) within the sequence are a summation of the previous two values (n-1) + (n-2).

- To run, within the containing directory, type: 'python fibonacci.py'
- The input is coded within the file where they can be edited.
- Examples return the 5th and 7th values of the sequence.

## fibonacci2.py

Another fibonacci algorithm with improved efficiency.

- The input is coded within the file where they can be edited.
- Examples return the 5th and 53rd values of the sequence.
